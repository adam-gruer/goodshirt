# Note please upgrade to version 3.0.0

The Good Place quotes API is no longer available. v 3.0.0 ships the
quote data with the package and remover calls to the defunct api.

# goodshirt

The goal of goodshirt is to provide The Good Place Quotes in your R
session. Previously an R client to The Good Place Quotes API by Klaudia
Rozgonyiova. <https://glitch.com/~good-place-quotes>
<https://github.com/EffingKay/the-good-place-quotes>

Now in version 3.0.0 API calls are removed and quotes data ships with
the package
